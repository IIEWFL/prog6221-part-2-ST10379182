How to use the RecipeApplication

Run the file, and a menu will appear up providing you with the option enter details for ingredients

Since you are using the app for the first time, it will not permit any options to function other than the option to enter a recipe.

It will then ask you for the number of ingredients, the quantities, its unit of measurement and lastly the number of steps.

Once you have successfully entered your recipe, it will be saved and displayed.

The Program also enables you to track the amount of calories you are intaking.
